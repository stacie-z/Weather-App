# Weather-App
A basic Node.js application that fetches the weather for your location.

This project was built out and slightly modified from Andrew Mead's "The Complete Node.js Developer Course."

NOTE: The 'node_modules' folder was removed for uploading and will need to be rebuilt prior to running.
